\section{Finite groups have logarithmic rank}\label{app:log}
This proof is an expanded version of the proof from \autocite{arvind07}.

Suppose $m$ is the size of the minimum generating set.
Let $H_0 = \gen{e}$, where $e$ is the identity element in $G$.
For each $i \in [m]$, let $H_i = \gen{H_{i - 1} \cup \{x_i\}}$ where $x_i \in G \setminus H_{i - 1}$.
Such an $x_i$ must exist for each $i$ because otherwise we would have some set $H_j$, of size less than $m$, which generates the group $G$; this violates the hypothesis that $m$ is the minimum size of a generating set for $G$.

Now, for each $i \in [m]$, we have $x_i \neq e$, by construction.
Furthermore, the cosets $x_i \gen{H_{i - 1}}$ and $e \gen{H_{i - 1}}$ are disjoint.
If we suppose to the contrary that there is some element $y \in e \gen{H_{i - 1}} \cap x_i \gen{H_{i - 1}}$, then $y = x_i h$ for some $h \in H_{i - 1}$, which implies $x_i = yh^{-1}$, and hence $x_i \in H_{i - 1}$ since both $y$ and $h$ are in $H_{i - 1}$.
This is a contradiction with the hypothesis that $x_i \in (G \setminus H_{i - 1})$.
Therefore $|H_i| \geq 2 |H_{i - 1}|$.
By induction, $|G| = |H_m| \geq 2^m$, which implies $m \leq \log |G| = \log n$.

Equality occurs with the elementary abelian $2$-group, $(\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z})^k$, for each positive integer $k$.
Let $n$ denote the order of this group, so $n = 2^k$.
The minimum generating set for this group is $\{e_1, \dotsc, e_k\}$, where $e_i$ is the $k$-tuple with a one in the $i$th position and a zero in each other position (if we consider the group as a vector space, $e_i$ is the standard basis vector).
Thus the group has a minimum generating set of size $k$, which is $\log n$.
