- We improve the best known upper bound for computing the rank of a group.
- We give one algorithm using a small circuit augmented with limited nondeterminism.
- We give another algorithm using both limited space and limited nondeterminism.
- Our upper bound implies a polynomial time algorithm for the problem.
