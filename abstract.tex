In this work we study the problem of computing the size of the minimum generating set of a finite group when given as a Cayley table using the lens of "bounded nondeterminism".
By determining exactly the amount of nondeterminism required to solve a computational problem (as opposed to requiring, for example, any polynomial amount), we can improve upper bounds for the problem.
Previously, the best upper bound for the minimum size generating set problem for general finite groups was $O(\log^2 n)$ space.
We show how to improve this to $O(\log n)$ space augmented with $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterminism.
 For restricted classes of finite groups, such as nilpotent groups and $p$-groups, we can prove even better upper bounds.
