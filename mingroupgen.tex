\section{Introduction}

In this work we study the problem of computing the size of the minimum generating set of a group.
Discuss previous work here, including Barrington and McKenzie showing the group membership problem is in $\SL$, and the $\DSPACE(\log^2 n)$ algorithm, \ldots.
Discuss also the relationship to computing the minimum generating set.

\section{Preliminaries}

\P{} is the class of decision problems decidable by a deterministic Turing machine halting in polynomial time.
$\L^2$ is the class of decision problems decidable by a deterministic Turing machine using at most $O(\log^2 n)$ space.
The (inclusion) relationship between \P{} and $\L^2$ is unknown.
Following the notation of Cai and Chen \cite{cc97}, $\GC(f(n), \mathcal{C})$ is the class of decision problems decidable by a $\mathcal{C}$ machine augmented with $O(f(n))$ nondeterministic bits.
We will consider specifically the complexity class $\GC(\log^2 n, \L)$.

If $(G, \cdot)$ is a group and $S$ is a subset of $G$ then the set of words on $S$ is denoted $S^*$ and the set of inverses of elements in $S$ is denoted $S^{-1}$.
If $T \subseteq G$, the set \emph{generated} by $T$, denoted $\gen{T}$, is the transitive closure of $\cdot$ on $T$.
A \emph{generating set} for $(G, \cdot)$ is a set $T \subseteq G$ such that $\gen{T} = G$.

\section{Computing the size of the minimum generating set}

\subsection{For groups}

Some applications may require computing the size of the minimum generating set for a given group.
In order to study its complexity, we define a decision problem corresponding to this optimization problem.
%%
%% \begin{definition}[\textsc{Minimum Group Generating Set}]
%%   \mbox{}

%%   \textbf{Instance:} finite group $(G, \cdot)$ (given as a Cayley table).

%%   \textbf{Solution:} finite set $T \subseteq G$ such that $\gen{T} = G$.

%%   \textbf{Measure:} $|T|$.

%%   \textbf{Type:} $\min$.
%% \end{definition}

%% TODO should this be called Min Group Gen Size
\begin{definition}[\textsc{Min Group Gen}]
  \mbox{}

  \textbf{Instance:} finite group $(G, \cdot)$ (given as a Cayley table), natural number $k$ (given in binary).

  \textbf{Question:} Does there exist a $T \subseteq G$ such that $\gen{T} = G$ and $|T| \leq k$?
\end{definition}

In order to show that the \textsc{Min Group Gen} problem is decidable in deterministic polynomial time, we reduce it to the \textsc{Min Group Rank} problem, which is known to be \P-complete \cite[Problem~A.8.11]{ghr95}.
%%
%% \begin{definition}[\textsc{Minimum Group Rank}]
%%   \mbox{}

%%   \textbf{Instance:} finite set $S$, finite set $U \subseteq (S \cup S^{-1})^*$.

%%   \textbf{Solution:} finite set $T \subseteq \gen{U}$ such that $\gen{T} = \gen{U}$.

%%   \textbf{Measure:} $|T|$.

%%   \textbf{Type:} $\min$.
%% \end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\textsc{Min Group Rank}]
  \mbox{}

  \textbf{Instance:} finite set $S$, finite set $U \subseteq (S \cup S^{-1})^*$, natural number $k$ (given in binary).

  \textbf{Question:} Does there exist a $T \subseteq \gen{U}$ such that $\gen{T} = \gen{U}$ and $|T| \leq k$?
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:mingenp}
  $\textsc{Min Group Gen} \in \P$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We show a logarithmic space many-one reduction from \textsc{Min Group Gen} to \textsc{Min Group Rank}.
  Since \textsc{Min Group Rank} is in \P{} and \P{} is closed under polynomial time many-one reductions, we conclude that \textsc{Min Group Rank} is also in \P.
  The reduction is the mapping $\langle (G, \cdot), k \rangle \mapsto \langle G, G, k \rangle$.
  First, we observe that $\langle G, G, k \rangle$ is a correctly formatted instance of the reduced problem: $G$ is a finite set and $G \subseteq (G \cup G^{-1})^*$.

  Suppose that $\langle (G, \cdot), k \rangle \in \textsc{Min Group Rank}$, so there exists a $T \subseteq G$ such that $\gen{T} = G$ and $|T| \leq k$.
  Since $G$ is closed under $\cdot$, we know $\gen{G} = G$ and hence $\gen{T} = \gen{G}$.
  Therefore we conclude that $\langle G, G, k \rangle \in \textsc{Min Group Rank}$.
  For the converse, suppose that $\langle G, G, k \rangle \in \textsc{Min Group Rank}$, so there exists a $T \subseteq \gen{G}$ such that $\gen{T} = \gen{G}$.
  As stated above, $\gen{G} = G$, so $\gen{T} = G$.
  Therefore $\langle (G, \cdot), k \rangle \in \textsc{Min Group Gen}$.

  We have shown a correct logarithmic space many-one reduction to a problem in \P, and we conclude that $\textsc{Min Group Gen} \in \P$.
\end{proof}

Previously, the \textsc{Min Group Gen} problem was known to be in $\L^2$, the class of problems decidable by a deterministic Turing machine using at most $O(\log^2 n)$ space \cite{lsz77} (see \cite[Proposition~3]{at06} for a brief description of the algorithm; I can't find a copy of \cite{lsz77} online).
We can improve this upper bound by a more careful analysis of the $\L^2$ algorithm.
We require a definition of the following auxiliary problem.

\begin{definition}[\textsc{Group Membership}]
  \mbox{}

  \textbf{Instance:} finite group $(G, \cdot)$ (given as a Cayley table), finite set $S \subset G$, group element $v \in G$.

  \textbf{Question:} Is $v \in \gen{X}$?
\end{definition}

The complexity of several restricted types of groups (cyclic, abelian, solvable, etc.) are explored in \cite{bklm01}, but no progress seems to have been made on the general group membership problem since it was shown to be in \SL{} by an $\NC^1$ reduction to the undirected s-t connectivity problem \cite[Section~3]{bm89}.
Using the fact that $\SL = \L$ \cite{reingold08}, we have that $\textsc{Group Membership} \in \L$.
We use the logarithmic space algorithm for this problem to give a simple $\GC(\log^2 n, \L)$ algorithm for \textsc{Min Group Gen}.

We require one algebraic lemma which bounds the size of the minimum generating set of a finite group.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:log}
  If $(G, \cdot)$ is a finite group then the size of the minimum generating set is at most $\log n$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Proof can be found at \url{http://math.stackexchange.com/a/226938/29369}, add it here.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:mingengc}
  $\textsc{Min Group Gen} \in \GC(\log^2 n, \L)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The algorithm proceeds as follows on input $\langle (G, \cdot), k \rangle$, where $G$ is a group of order $n$ with distinguished identity element $e$:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Nondeterministically guess a subset $S \subseteq G$ of cardinality at most $k$.
  \item Accept if and only if for all $v \in G$, $\langle G, S, v \rangle \in \textsc{Group Membership}$.
  \end{itemize}

  First we prove that this algorithm uses $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits and $O(\log n)$ space.
  The size of each group element, represented as number in binary, is $\log n$.
  By \autoref{lem:log}, we assume without loss of generality that the size of the minimum generating set for a group of order $n$ is at most $\log n$, so $k$ must be at most $\log n$.
  Therefore the total number of nondeterministic bits required to guess $S$ is $O(\log^2 n)$.
  Iterating over all elements of $G$ requires $O(\log n)$ space to keep track of the current element in the iteration.
  Since $\textsc{Group Membership} \in \L$ by the above discussion, deciding whether $\langle G, S, v \rangle \in \textsc{Group Membership}$ uses at most $O(\log n)$ space.
  Therefore the total space required for this algorithm (other than the read-only input and read-only nondeterministic bits) is $O(\log n)$.

  Next we show that the algorithm correctly decides the problem.
  Suppose $\langle (G, \cdot), k) \rangle \in \textsc{Min Group Gen}$, so there exists a $T \subseteq G$ such that $|T| \leq k$ and $\gen{T} = G$.
  One of the sets $S$ of cardinality at most $k$ that the algorithm guesses will equal $T$, since $|T| \leq k$.
  For all elements $v \in G$, we have $v \in \gen{T}$ since $\gen{T} = G$.
  Hence the (correct) algorithm for \textsc{Group Membership} will accept for all $v \in G$, and the overall algorithm will accept.
  For the converse, suppose the algorithm accepts the input $\langle (G, \cdot), k \rangle$.
  This occurs exactly when it has guessed a set $S$ of cardinality at most $k$ such that all elements $v$ in $G$ are members of the subgroup generated by $S$.
  Thus $S$ is a generating set for $G$ of cardinality at most $k$, so $\langle (G, \cdot), k \in \textsc{Min Group Gen}$.
\end{proof}

This improves the previous upper bound of $\L^2$ because
\begin{equation*}
  \GC(\log^2 n, \L) \subseteq \GC(\log^2 n, \NC^2) \subseteq \L^2,
\end{equation*}
where the first inclusion follows from the fact that $\L \subseteq \NL \subseteq \NC^2$, and the second is proven in \cite[Lemma~3.2.8]{wolf90}.

From \autoref{lem:mingenp} and \autoref{lem:mingengc}, we immediately get the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
  $\textsc{Min Group Gen} \in \GC(\log^2 n, \L) \cap \P$.
\end{theorem}

We conjecture that this is not the best possible upper bound, and more clever algebra may reveal a more efficient algorithm.

\begin{conjecture}
  $\textsc{Min Group Gen} \in \L$.
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{For special cases}

In this section we provide a clearer presentation of the proof of \cite[Theorem~7]{at06}.
TODO add to this section the result of using the results from \cite{bklm01} and the algorithm from \autoref{lem:mingengc} to place these problems in smaller complexity classes.

\begin{proposition}
  $\textsc{Min Nilp. Group Gen} \leq_{ctt}^P \textsc{Min p-Group Gen}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Define the reduction by
  \begin{equation*}
    \langle G, k \rangle \mapsto \bigwedge_{i=1}^m \langle S_{p_i}, k \rangle
  \end{equation*}
  for all nilpotent groups $G$ of order $n$ and all postive integers $k$, where the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\dotsb p_m^{e_m}$ and $S_{p_i}$ is the unique $p_i$-Sylow subgroup of $G$.
  Since the length of the input is $n^2$, the prime factorization of $n$ can be computed in polynomial time with respect to the length of the input.
  For each $i$, the Cayley table of the $p_i$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ can be computed in polynomial time because \ldots.
  The number of clauses in the conjunction is $m$, which is the number of prime factors of $n$, which is bounded by a polynomial in $n^2$ because \ldots.
  Hence the reduction is polynomial time computable.

  Suppose $\langle G, k \rangle \in \textsc{Min Nilp. Group Gen}$.
  \ldots
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  $\textsc{Min p-Group Gen} \leq_m^P \textsc{Min Elem. Abel. Group Gen}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Define the reduction by
  \begin{equation*}
    \langle G, k \rangle \mapsto \left\langle \frac{G}{\Phi(G)}, k \right\rangle
  \end{equation*}
  for all $p$-groups $G$ of order $n$ and all positive integers $k$, where $\Phi(G)$ is the Frattini subgroup of $G$.
  By \autoref{lem:frattinip}, the Cayley table of $\Phi(G)$ is computable in polynomial time.
  By \autoref{lem:factorgroup}, the Cayley table of $\frac{G}{\Phi(G)}$ is computable in polynomial time.
  Hence the reduction is polynomial time computable.

  \ldots
\end{proof}
