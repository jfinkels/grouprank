\section{Introduction}
% Foreword
%
% context (focus on anyone) why now? - current situation, and why the need is so important
An efficient algorithm computing the rank of a finite algebraic structure (that is, the minimum number of elements required to generate all other elements) benefits mathematicians, who use numerical algebra systems for research, cryptographers, who rely on algebraic systems for proofs of security, and theoretical computer scientists, who seek to understand which problems can be solved in a particular model of computation.
If the structure is, for example, a finite group, then we can represent this structure in one of two reasonable ways.
First, we can represent it as a subset of elements along with a set of equality relations demonstrating how the group operation behaves (known as a group presentation).
Second, we can represent it as a table of values for the binary operation under each pair of input elements (known as a Cayley table or multiplication table).
These representations offer a tradeoff between representation size and the complexity of deciding properties of the group: the latter representation may be exponentially larger than the former, so an efficient algorithm for the latter may not necessarily be efficient for the former.

Consider the situation when the algebraic structure is the finite cyclic group of order $n$.
A natural presentation of this group is $\langle a \, | \, a^n = 1 \rangle$.
Since each element in this group can be represented by $O(\log n)$ bits, the total size of this representation is $O(\log n)$ bits.
In contrast, the Cayley table for this group requires $O(n^2 \log n)$ bits.
Thus, in certain cases, if $m$ represents the size of the input, an algorithm running in time $f(m)$ on inputs of the first form runs in time $O(f(\log m))$ on inputs of the second form.
We can use this to our advantage to construct more efficient algorithms for algebraic problems.

% need (focus on readers) why you? - why this is relevant to the reader, and why something needed to be done
%
%%% relevant existing work, given as part of the need
For quasigroups, the previous best algorithm for computing the rank requires polynomial time in addition to a polylogarithmic amount of nondeterministic bits.
For groups, the previous best algorithm for computing the rank requires a polylogarithmic amount of space, which induces a superpolynomial time (hence, inefficient) algorithm.
Only for certain classes of finite groups was there a polynomial time algorithm.
% task (focus on author) why me? - what was undertaken to address the need
We reduce the best upper bound on the complexity of the rank problem for quasigroups and groups and provide a theoretically efficient algorithm for the latter.
% object (focus on document) why this document - what the document covers
This paper proves that with short certificates of correctness, the rank problem for quasigroups and groups can be verified by highly restricted models of computation, and demonstrates how the same strategy can be applied to semigroups and magmas in general.

% Summary
%
% findings (focus on author) what? - what the work revealed when performing the task
We prove that the problem of deciding whether the rank of a finite quasigroup, given as a Cayley table, is smaller than a specified number is decidable by a circuit of depth $O(\log \log n)$ augmented with $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits (the complexity class of problems decidable by such circuits is denoted $\bFOLL$).
Furthermore, if the quasigroup is a group, then the problem is also decidable by a Turing machine using $O(\log n)$ space and $O(\log^2 n)$ bits of nondeterminism (the complexity class for problems like this is denoted $\bL$).
The general strategy is to reduce the problem of computing rank to the problem of computing membership; we compute the rank of a group by guessing a small set of candidate generators, then deciding whether each other element in the group can be generated from that set.
For the sake of completeness, we show how this strategy applies to semigroups and magmas in general, though the results are less interesting there because these algebraic structures lack two things that the groups and quasigroups have: small generating sets and efficient membership algorithms.
The problem is in $\NL$ for semigroups and in $\NP$ for general magmas.
\autoref{tab:summary} summarizes these improvements, and \autoref{fig:inclusions} demonstrates graphically why these improvements are so significant.
(We could not find an explicit upper bound for magmas and semigroups, but other papers imply that the problems are in $\NP$.)

% conclusion (focus on readers) so what? - what the findings mean for the audience
These are improvements on the previous best upper bounds for these problems.
Previously, the best upper bound for computing the rank of a quasigroup given as a Cayley table was $\bP$ \autocite[Section~5]{py96} and for groups, $\L^2$ \autocite{lsz77} (see also \cite[Proposition~6]{at06} for a brief description of the algorithm).
Our results are an improvement because
\begin{equation*}
  (\bFOLL \cap \bL) \subseteq \NL \subseteq (\L^2 \cap \P).
\end{equation*}
%% This is an improvement because
%% \begin{align*}
%%   (\bFOLL \cap \bL) & \subseteq \bL \subseteq \NL \subseteq \AC^1 \subseteq \bAC^1, \\ %\subseteq \bNC^2 \subseteq \L^2,
%%   (\bFOLL \cap \bL) & \subseteq \bFOLL \subseteq \bAC^1, %\subseteq \bNC^2 \subseteq \L^2.
%% \end{align*}
%% and
%% $$
%% \bAC^1 \subseteq \bNC^2 \subseteq \L^2.
%% $$
%% (In the last inclusion we use the fact that $\bNC^2 \subseteq \L^2$ \cite[Lemma~3.1]{wolf94}.)
This also improves the result of \cite[Theorem~7]{at06}, which shows that computing the rank of a nilpotent group is in $\P$.
However, the relationship between $\FOLL$ and $\L$ remains unknown (the best inclusion known is the uninteresting inclusion $\FOLL \subseteq \AC^1$), so the relationship between $\bFOLL$ and $\bL$ is unknown as well.
Still, for groups, the problem is decidable by an extremely restrictive computational model, and so can be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
Finally, contrast the complexity of the rank problem for groups with the complexity of computing the rank of a subgroup of a free group.
The latter problem is $\P$-complete, so is not even in $\NC$ unless $\NC = \P$ \autocite[Theorem~4.9]{am84} (see also \autocite[Problem~A.8.11]{ghr95}).

% perspective (focus on anyone) what now? - what should be done next
Using limited nondeterminism and restrictive models of computation as verifiers may also be useful in examining other problems.
The limited nondeterminism lens suggests some opportunities for further research in computational algebra specifically, though it has seen some recent success in other subfields of theoretical computer science (see \autocite{gottlob13}, for example).
Can computing the rank of a quasigroup, a problem more general than computing the rank of a group, also be computed by a logarithmic space Turing machine using $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterminism?
Is there a reduction between the problem of computing the rank of a quasigroup and the problem of deciding whether two quasigroups are isomorphic?
Finally, is the problem of computing the shortest generating sequence for a quasigroup strictly more difficult than the problem of computing the rank of a quasigroup?

\section{Preliminaries}

Here, $\log n$ denotes the base two logarithm of $n$, for any natural number $n$.
Also, the set $\{1, \dotsc, n\}$ is denoted $[n]$.

\subsection{Complexity}

$\L$ is the class of languages decidable by a deterministic Turing machine that uses $O(\log n)$ space on inputs of length $n$.
$\L^2$ is the class of languages decidable by a deterministic Turing machine that uses $O(\log^2 n)$ space.
$\NL$ is the class of languages decidable by a nondeterministic Turing machine that uses $O(\log n)$ space.
$\bL$ is the subclass of $\NL$ in which the nondeterministic Turing machine uses at most $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits.
$\FOLL$ is the class of languages decidable by a $\L$-uniform family of circuits with polynomial size, unbounded fan-in, and $O(\log \log n)$ depth.
$\bFOLL$ is the class of languages decidable by $\FOLL$ circuits that have been augmented with $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits (gates with no inputs and one output).
$\AC_0$ and $\bAC_0$ are the restrictions of $\FOLL$ and $\bFOLL$, respectively, to depth $O(1)$.
In general, the class $\beta_2 \mathcal{C}$ ($\mathsf{N} \mathcal{C}$, respectively) is the class of languages decidable by $\mathcal{C}$ machines augmented with $O(\log^2 n)$ bits (polynomial bits, respectively) of nondeterminism, or equivalently, the class of languages verifiable by $\mathcal{C}$ machines when given a certificate of length $O(\log^2 n)$ (polynomial in $n$, respectively).

If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are languages, there is a \emph{$\bAC_0$ conjunctive truth-table reduction} from $L_1$ to $L_2$, denoted $L_1 \leq^{\bAC_0}_{ctt} L_2$, if there is a function $f$ and a polynomial $p$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is computable in $\bAC_0$,
\item $f(x)$ outputs $(y_1, \dotsc, y_{p(n)})$ where $n$ is the length of $x$,
\item $x \in L_1$ if and only if $\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{p(n)} y_i \in L_2$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ctt}
  Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are languages.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $L_1 \leq^{\NAC_0}_{ctt} L_2$ and $L_2$ is in $\P$, then $L_1$ is in $\NP$.
  \item If $L_1 \leq^{\NAC_0}_{ctt} L_2$ and $L_2$ is in $\NL$, then $L_1$ is in $\NL$.
  \item If $L_1 \leq^{\bAC_0}_{ctt} L_2$ and $L_2$ is in $\FOLL$, then $L_1$ is in $\bFOLL$.
  \item If $L_1 \leq^{\bAC_0}_{ctt} L_2$ and $L_2$ is in $\L$, then $L_1$ is in $\bL$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  In each case, let $f$ denote the reduction and $M_2$ denote the machine that decides $L_2$.
  The machine that decides $L_1$, call it $M_1$, simulates $f$ on its input then runs $M_2$ on each component of the output of $f$.
  The machine $M_1$ accepts if and only if each of the simulations of $M_2$ accepts.
  The correctness of $M_1$ follows from the correctness of $f$ and $M_2$.
  The only remaining issue is the complexity of $M_1$.

  For the first two cases, we use the fact that $\NAC_0 \subseteq (\NP \cap \NL)$.
  We define the machine $M_1$ so that it chooses all its nondeterministic bits at the beginning of its computation.
  More specifically, if $f$ requires $p(n)$ nondeterministic bits, the length of the output of $f$ is $q(n)$, and $M_2$ requires $r(n)$ nondeterministic bits, then $M_1$ uses at most $p(n) + q(n) r(q(n))$ nondeterministic bits, which is a polynomial since $p$, $q$, and $r$ are polynomials.

  In the first case, the $\NP$ machine $M_1$, after choosing a sufficient number of nondeterministic bits, can simulate $f$ in polynomial time and can simulate a polynomial number of instances of $M_2$ (specifically, $q(n)$ instances) in polynomial time.
  In the second case, the $\NL$ machine does the same thing, but requires the fact that logarithmic space computable functions compose.

  For the last two cases, we use the fact that $\bAC_0 \subseteq (\bFOLL \cap \bL)$.
  If $L_2$ is in $\FOLL$, we define $M_1$ to be the circuit
  \begin{equation*}
    M_1(x, w) = \bigwedge_{i = 1}^{q(n)} M_2(y_i),
  \end{equation*}
  where $n$ is the length of $x$, the string $w$ is the nondeterministic string of length $O(\log^2 n)$, and $q(n)$ is the polynomial bounding the number of outputs of $f$ on inputs of length $n$.
  The depth of the $M_1$ circuit is the depth of $f$ plus the depth of $M_2$, which is $O(1) + O(\log \log n)$, or simply $O(\log \log n)$.
  The number of nondeterministic bits required by $M_1$ is the same as the number of nondeterministic bits required by $f$, which is $O(\log^2 n)$.
  The circuit is polynomial in size because $f$ is polynomial in size, $M_2$ is polynomial in size, and there are a polynomial number of parallel instances of the circuit $M_2$.
  Thus $M_1$ is in $\bFOLL$.

  The proof is similar if $L_2$ is in $\L$.
  The only difference is that instead of a circuit computing the conjunction of $q(n)$ bits, we loop over each $y_i$ and check if each one causes $M_2$ to accept.
  Since there are a polynomial number of them, indexing them requires only logarithmic space.
  We also require the fact that logarithmic space computable functions compose.
\end{proof}

Finally, if $L$ is a language and $F$ is a function, there is a \emph{nonadaptive $\AC_0$ Turing reduction} from $L$ to $F$ if there is an $\AC_0$ function $g$ and an $\AC_0$ circuit $C$ such that $x \in L$ if and only if $C(x, F(y_1), \dotsc, F(y_m)) = 1$, where $(y_1, \dotsc, y_m)$ is the output of $g(x)$ and $m$ is bounded by a polynomial in $|x|$.
The function $g$ is called the \emph{generator of the reduction} and the circuit $C$ is called the \emph{evaluator of the reduction}.

\subsection{Algebra}

An \emph{magma} is a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ that is closed on $G$.
Unless otherwise stated, we will only consider \emph{finite magmas}, in which $G$ is a finite set.
The \emph{Cayley table} of a magma with $n$ elements is the $n \times n$ table whose rows and columns are indexed by the elements of $G$ and where entry $(a, b)$ has value $c$ if $a \cdot b = c$.
If the binary operation is associative, the magma is called a \emph{semigroup}.
If the binary operation has the property that for each $a$ and $b$ in $G$ there are unique elements $x$ and $y$ in $G$ such that $a \cdot x = b$ and $y \cdot a = b$, the magma is called a \emph{quasigroup}.
(In other words, each quasigroup element appears exactly once in each row and each column of the Cayley table of $G$, or the Cayley table is a \emph{Latin square}.)
If a quasigroup is nonempty and associative, then it is a \emph{group}.
Alternately, if a semigroup has an identity and inverses, then it is a group.
%% Thus if a magma is nonempty, a semigroup, and a quasigroup, it is a group.

\begin{example}\label{ex:quasigroup}
  The smallest nonempty quasigroup that is not also a group has three elements, $\{a, b, c\}$.
  Its Cayley table is
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c | c c c}
      \cdot & a & b & c \\
      \hline
      a & a & b & c \\
      b & c & a & b \\
      c & b & c & a \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  Examining the table reveals that there is exactly one of each quasigroup element in each row and column.
  This quasigroup is not associative because $b \cdot (a \cdot b) = b \cdot b = a$ but $(b \cdot a) \cdot b = c \cdot b = c$.
  Also, it has a left identity, $a$, but no right identity.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:zero}
  The \emph{right zero semigroup} is the semigroup in which each element is a right zero.
  Its Cayley table is
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c | c c c}
      \cdot & a & b & c \\
      \hline
      a & a & b & c \\
      b & a & b & c \\
      c & a & b & c \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  The associativity of this semigroup can be determined by examining all possible triples $(x, y, z)$ in $G^3$ and checking that $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$.
  Each element of this semigroup is a left identity and a right zero, but there are no right identities, so it is not a group.

  Unlike for the Latin square property in the previous example, there is no obvious way to tell whether a binary operation is associative simply by scanning the rows and columns.
  In other words, given only its Cayley table, determining whether a magma is a quasigroup \emph{seems} easier than determining whether a magma is a semigroup.
  However, there is a polynomial time algorithm, attributed to F.~W.~Light, for deciding whether a magma is associative; it is simply the naïve algorithmic implementation of the associativity condition.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  There is a unique (up to isomorphism) group on three elements $\{a, b, c\}$.
  Its Cayley table is
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{c | c c c}
      \cdot & a & b & c \\
      \hline
      a & a & b & c \\
      b & b & c & a \\
      c & c & a & b \\
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  This group is the group of integers under addition modulo three.
  It is both a semigroup and a quasigroup.
\end{example}

A \emph{parenthesization} $P$ of a sequence of magma elements $(g_1, \dotsc, g_k)$ is a binary tree that has the magma elements as its leaves (in the order indicated by the sequence).
The \emph{parenthesized product} of a sequence of magma elements $(g_1, \dotsc, g_k)$ with parenthesization $P$, denoted $P(g_1, \dotsc, g_k)$, is the element that results from performing the magma operation in the order indicated by the parenthesization.

\begin{example}
  Consider $(a, c, a, b)$, a sequence of four elements from the quasigroup defined in \autoref{ex:quasigroup}.
  One parenthesization of this sequence is
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=0.5, yscale=0.3]
      \node[minimum size=0pt, inner sep=0pt] {}
      child {
        child {
          child {node {$a$}}
          child[color=white] {}
        }
        child[color=white] {}
      }
      child {
        child {
          child {node {$c$}}
          child {node {$a$}}
        }
        child {
          child[color=white] {}
          child {node {$b$}}
        }
      };
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{equation*}
  which corresponds to the parenthesized product $a \cdot ((c \cdot a) \cdot b)$.
  According to the Cayley table, this product equals $a$.
\end{example}

If $S$ is a subset of magma elements, the \emph{submagma} generated by $S$, denoted $\gen{S}$, is the closure of $S$ under the magma operation and under any parenthesization.
(For semigroups, and hence for groups, the operation is associative, so the parenthesization is superfluous.)
If $\gen{S} = G$, then $S$ is called a \emph{generating set for $G$}.
The \emph{rank of a magma $G$}, denoted $\rank(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a generating set.
This terminology extends to semigroups and groups as well.

\begin{example}\label{ex:semigroupgen}
  Consider the right zero semigroup on $n$ elements, a generalization of \autoref{ex:zero}.
  In this semigroup, call it $G$, we have $x \cdot y = y$ for each $x$ and $y$ in $G$.
  The rank of this semigroup must be $n$.
  Assume for the sake of producing a contradiction that the rank is strictly less than $n$.
  Thus there is an element $z$ not in the generating set such that $x_1 \cdot \dotsb \cdot x_n = z$, where each $x_i$ is an element of the generating set.
  This is a contradiction with the fact that $x_1 \cdot \dotsb \cdot x_n = x_n$, since $x_n$ is a right zero.
  Therefore the rank of the semigroup must be $n$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:elementary}
  Consider the elementary abelian $2$-group, $(\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z})^k$, for some positive integer $k$.
  Let $n$ denote the order of this group, so $n = 2^k$.
  The minimum generating set for this group is $\{e_1, \dotsc, e_k\}$, where $e_i$ is the $k$-tuple with a one in the $i$th position and a zero in each other position (if we consider the group as a vector space, $e_i$ is the standard basis vector).
  Thus the group has a minimum generating set of size $k$, which is $\log n$.
\end{example}

For quasigroups, we consider a slightly more specific notion of ``generating''\kern-0.5em.
If $(g_0, \dotsc, g_k)$ is a finite sequence of quasigroup elements denoted $S$ and $P$ is a parenthesization of that sequence, then the \emph{cube of $S$ with respect to $P$}, denoted $\cube_P(S)$, is defined
\begin{equation*}
  \cube_P(S) = \left\{P(g_0, g_1^{\epsilon_1}, \dotsc, g_k^{\epsilon_k}) \, \middle| \, \epsilon_i \in \{0, 1\} \text{ for each } i \right\}.
\end{equation*}
(This is called a ``cube'' because each vertex of the $k$-dimensional Boolean hypercube, when interpreted as a binary string $\epsilon_1 \dotsb \epsilon_k$, yields a quasigroup element.)
If $\cube_P(S) = G$, then $g$ is called a \emph{cube generating sequence of size $k + 1$} for the quasigroup $G$.
The \emph{rank of a quasigroup $G$}, denoted $\rank(G)$, is the minimum size of a cube generating sequence.%
\footnote{
  This is a nonstandard definition of ``rank'' for quasigroups.
  Elsewhere, the rank of a quasigroup is the number of blocks in the partition of the quasigroup into conjugacy classes according to the action of the quasigroup on itself.
}
Contrast the rank of a quasigroup with the rank of a semigroup: the former is the size of a sequence, the latter the size of a set.

\begin{example}
  \todo{Example of a cube generating sequence for a quasigroup.}
\end{example}

Quasigroups have small cube generating sequences, and groups have small generating sets.
As of this publication, upper bounds on the size of generating sets for semigroups remain the subject of research \autocite{gray14}, although in general, some semigroups of order $n$ have rank $n$ (see \autoref{ex:semigroupgen}).
Magmas have even less structure than semigroups, and hence lack a meaningful upper bound as well.

An upper bound for the minimum size of a generating set for quasigroups can be proven by the probabilistic method.

\begin{lemma}[{\autocite[Theorem~3.3]{ctw13}}]\label{lem:small}
  Each finite quasigroup with $n$ elements has a cube generating sequence of size $O(\log n)$ with a parenthesization of depth $O(\log \log n)$.
\end{lemma}

Since a group is a quasigroup, and since a cube generating sequence induces a generating set, the same upper bound can be applied to groups.
However, a more specific (and constructive) upper bound can be proven inductively by considering cosets of increasing size.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:log}
  If $G$ is a finite group of order $n$ then the minimum size of a generating set is at most $\log n$, with equality when the group is a finite elementary abelian $2$-group.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This proof is an expanded version of the proof from \autocite{arvind07}.

  Suppose $m$ is the size of the minimum generating set.
  Let $H_0 = \gen{e}$, where $e$ is the identity element in $G$.
  For each $i \in [m]$, let $H_i = \gen{H_{i - 1} \cup \{x_i\}}$ where $x_i \in G \setminus H_{i - 1}$.
  Such an $x_i$ must exist for each $i$ because otherwise we would have some set $H_j$, of size less than $m$, which generates the group $G$; this violates the hypothesis that $m$ is the minimum size of a generating set for $G$.

  Now, for each $i \in [m]$, we have $x_i \neq e$, by construction.
  Furthermore, the cosets $x_i \gen{H_{i - 1}}$ and $e \gen{H_{i - 1}}$ are disjoint.
  If we suppose to the contrary that there is some element $y \in e \gen{H_{i - 1}} \cap x_i \gen{H_{i - 1}}$, then $y = x_i h$ for some $h \in H_{i - 1}$, which implies $x_i = yh^{-1}$, and hence $x_i \in H_{i - 1}$ since both $y$ and $h$ are in $H_{i - 1}$.
  This is a contradiction with the hypothesis that $x_i \in (G \setminus H_{i - 1})$.
  Therefore $|H_i| \geq 2 |H_{i - 1}|$.
  By induction, $|G| = |H_m| \geq 2^m$, which implies $m \leq \log |G| = \log n$.

  The equality follows from \autoref{ex:elementary}.

The \textsc{Submagma Membership} problem is defined as follows.
The inputs are a magma $G$ given as a Cayley table, a magma element $h$, and a finite set of magma elements $S$.
The problem is to decide whether $h \in \gen{S}$.

\begin{lemma}[{\autocite[Corollary~9]{jl76}}]\label{lem:submagmamem}
  \textsc{Submagma Membership} is $\P$-complete.
\end{lemma}
%% \begin{proof}
%%   Suppose the magma has $n$ elements and $h$ is the element to check for submagma membership.
%%   The certificate is a sequence of $n$ elements chosen from $S$ and a parenthesization $P$ of that sequence.
%%   (We choose a sequence of $n$ elements from $S$ because in the worst case, the magma is the cyclic group of order $n$, the set $S$ is the singleton set $\{1\}$, and $h$ is $1^n$.)
%%   The verification procedure computes the parenthesized product and checks that it is $h$.

%%   Each element can be represented with $O(\log n)$ bits, so a sequence of $n$ such elements can be represented with $O(n \log n)$ bits.
%%   The parenthesization can be represented as a binary string of length $n$.
%%   Thus the overall size of the certificate is $O(n \log n)$.
%% \end{proof}

The \textsc{Subsemigroup Membership} problem is defined as follows.
The inputs are a semigroup $G$ given as a Cayley table, a semigroup element $h$, and a finite set $S$ of semigroup elements.
The problem is to decide whether $h \in \gen{S}$.

\begin{lemma}[{\autocite{jll76}}]\label{lem:subsemigroupmem}
  \textsc{Subsemigroup Membership} is $\NL$-complete.
\end{lemma}
%% \begin{proof}
%%   We will show a logarithmic space disjunctive truth-table reduction from \textsc{Subsemigroup Membership} to \textsc{Directed Path}.
%%   Since the latter problem is in $\NL$ and $\NL$ is closed under this type of reduction, we conclude that the former problem is in $\NL$ as well.

%%   Suppose $G$ is the semigroup, $h$ is the semigroup element, and $S$ is the set of subsemigroup generators described in the problem definition.
%%   The Cayley table induces an edge-labeled directed multigraph $\Gamma$ with self-loops: the vertices of the graph are the semigroup elements, and for each semigroup element $a$, $b$, and $c$, there is an edge labeled $b$ from $a$ to $c$ if $a \cdot b = c$.
%%   Consider the subgraph $\Gamma_S$ induced by those edges whose labels are in $S$.
%%   The element $h$ is in $\gen{S}$ if and only if there is a path from some vertex in $S$ to $h$.
%%   In other words, if $S = \{s_1, \dotsc, s_m\}$ for some natural number $m$,
%%   %% and $\Path(\Gamma_S, h, s_i)$ is a proposition that is true exactly when there is a directed path from $h$ to $s_i$ in $\Gamma_S$,
%%   \begin{equation*}
%%     h \in \gen{S} \iff \bigvee_{i = 1}^m (\Gamma_S, h, s_i) \in \textsc{Directed Path}.
%%   \end{equation*}
%%   Therefore we choose the reduction to be $(G, h, S) \mapsto ((\Gamma_S, h, s_1), \dotsc, (\Gamma_S, h, s_m))$.

%%   Computing the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma_S$ from the Cayley table of $G$ and the set $S$ can be done in logarithmic space by setting each entry $(x, y)$ in the Cayley table to be zero if $y$ is not in $S$.
%%   Iterating over all edges in the adjacency matrix requires logarithmic space, and enumerating each of the $m$ outputs requires space logarithmic in $m$, which is logarithmic in $n$ because $m \leq n$.
%%   We conclude that the reduction is a correct logarithmic space disjunctive truth-table reduction.
%% \end{proof}

The \textsc{Cube Membership} problem is defined as follows.
The inputs are a quasigroup $G$ given as a Cayley table, a quasigroup element $h$, a finite \emph{sequence} of quasigroup elements $S$, and a parenthesization $P$ for that sequence.
The problem is to decide whether $h \in \cube_P(S)$.

How does a circuit access a Cayley table for a quasigroup of order $n$?%
\footnote{This work avoids representing problems using first-order logic, as in the original definition of $\FOLL$ from \autocite{bklm01}, though the logic definition may provide a more natural representation of this sort of information.}
One way for a circuit to compute the product of two quasigroup elements using the Cayley table is via a multiplexer.
In the multiplexer, each input has $O(\log n)$ bits, since each quasigroup element can be represented with $O(\log n)$ bits and each input is a pair of quasigroup elements.
A multiplexer that selects from $n^2$ inputs, each of length $O(\log n)$, can be implemented by an \emph{unbounded fan-in} circuit of depth $O(1)$ and size $O(n^2 \log n)$.

\begin{lemma}[{Implicit in \autocite[Theorem~3.4]{ctw13}}]\label{lem:cubemem}
  \textsc{Cube Membership} is decidable by an $\L$-uniform family of unbounded fan-in circuits with size $O(2^k k n^2 \log n)$ and depth $O(d)$, where $n$ is the order of the quasigroup, $k$ is the size of the generating sequence, and $d$ is the depth of the parenthesization.

  %In particular, if $k$ is in $O(\log n)$ and $d$ is in $O(\log \log n)$, then the circuit is of size polynomial in $n$ and of depth $O(\log \log n)$, that is, \textsc{Cube Membership} is in $\FOLL$.
  In particular, if $k = O(\log n)$ and $d = O(\log \log n)$, then \textsc{Cube Membership} is in $\FOLL$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The input to the circuit is the Cayley table for a quasigroup, a quasigroup element $h$, a generating sequence $S$, and a parenthesization $P$.
  Suppose $S = (g_0, \dotsc, g_k)$ for some positive integer $k$.
  Since the circuit needs to determine if $h$ is in $\cube_P(S)$, the circuit accepts if and only if there is some sequence of bits $(\epsilon_1, \dotsc, \epsilon_k)$ such that $h = P(g_0, g_1^{\epsilon_1}, \dotsc, g_k^{\epsilon_k})$.
  Thus the circuit consists of $2^k$ subcircuits joined to a single \textsc{or} gate, each subcircuit deciding whether one of the $2^k$ possible $k$-bit sequences $(\epsilon_1, \dotsc, \epsilon_k)$ produces $h$ under the given parenthesization.

  The subcircuit corresponding to binary sequence $(\epsilon_1, \dotsc, \epsilon_k)$ computes the parenthesized product $P(g_0, g_1^{\epsilon_1}, \dotsc, g_k^{\epsilon_k})$.
  Computing the product of two quasigroup elements can be implemented in $O(n^2 \log n)$ size and $O(1)$ depth, as described in the paragraph preceding this lemma.
  Computing the parenthesized product therefore can be implemented in $O(k n^2 \log n)$ size and $O(d)$ depth, where $d$ is the depth of the parenthesization.
  Comparing the element produced this way to the element $h$ can be done with a constant depth, $O(\log n)$ size equality comparison circuit.

  We conclude that the overall size of the circuit is $O(2^k k n^2 \log n)$ and the overall depth of the circuit is $O(d)$.
\end{proof}

The \textsc{Subgroup Membership} problem is defined as follows.
The inputs are a group $G$ given as a Cayley table, a group element $h$, and a finite set $S$ of group elements.
The problem is to decide whether $h \in \gen{S}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:subgroupmem}
  \textsc{Subgroup Membership} is in $\L$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The problem is in $\SL$ by a reduction to \textsc{Undirected Path} \autocite[Section~3]{bm89}, and $\SL = \L$ \cite{reingold08}.
\end{proof}

We conjecture that for magmas and semigroups, the problems are hard for their respective complexity classes.

The \textsc{Magma Rank} problem is defined as follows.
Given the Cayley table of a magma and an integer $k$ in unary, decide whether the rank of the magma is $k$ or less.
The restrictions of this problem to quasigroups, semigroups, and groups, respectively, are defined similarly.
The integer $k$ is given in unary in order to facilitate the construction of uniform circuit families that decide the problem; since the size of the Cayley table is $n^2 \log n$ and $k$ is always at most $n$, encoding the integer in unary does not cause an exponential increase in the size of the input to the problems.

The reductions in the following lemma are implicit in \autocite[Theorem~3.4]{ctw13}.
That theorem demonstrates a $\bFOLL$ algorithm for deciding whether two quasigroups are isomorphic, and the first part of that algorithm determines whether a given sequence of quasigroup elements with a parenthesization is a cube generating sequence.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ranktomem}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\textsc{Magma Rank} \leq^{\NAC_0}_{ctt} \textsc{Submagma Membership}$.
  \item $\textsc{Semigroup Rank} \leq^{\NAC_0}_{ctt} \textsc{Subsemigroup Membership}$.
  \item $\textsc{Quasigroup Rank} \leq^{\bAC_0}_{ctt} \textsc{Cube Membership}$.
  \item $\textsc{Group Rank} \leq^{\bAC_0}_{ctt} \textsc{Subgroup Membership}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  First, consider the problem for magmas.
  Unlike for quasigroups and groups (\autoref{lem:small} and \autoref{lem:log}), we have no general upper bound on the minimum size of a generating set for magmas.
  Thus, the best we can do is nondeterministically choose a set of $k$ generators and determine if that set generates the magma, where $k$ can be as large as the number of elements in the magma.

  Let $g_1, \dotsc, g_n$ denote the elements of a magma.
  The reduction proceeds as follows.
  On input $(G, k)$, where $G$ is a magma on $n$ elements given as its Cayley table and $k$ is a positive integer given in unary, nondeterministically choose a sequence $S$ of $k$ magma elements.
  Output $((G, g_1, S), \dotsc, (G, g_n, S))$.

  Since each magma element can be represented by $O(\log n)$ bits, the number of nondeterministic bits used is $O(n \log n)$.
  By definition of rank,
  \begin{equation*}
    \rank(G) \leq k \iff \bigwedge_{i = 1}^n g_i \in \gen{S},
  \end{equation*}
  so the reduction is a correct conjunctive truth-table reduction.
  For semigroups, we apply the exact same reduction.

  For quasigroups, the only differences are that we need to nondeterministically choose a parenthesization as well as a generating sequence, and that we have an upper bound on the size of the sequence and the parenthesization.
  By \autoref{lem:small}, it suffices to consider inputs to \textsc{Quasigroup Rank} in which $k$ is in $O(\log n)$ and inputs to \textsc{Cube Membership} in which $P$ is of depth $O(\log \log n)$.
  The reduction therefore must nondeterministically choose a sequence $S$ of $k$ quasigroup elements and a parenthesization $P$ of depth $O(\log \log n)$.
  The output of the reduction is $((G, g_1, S, P), \dotsc, (G, g_n, S, P))$.
  Now the number of nondeterministic bits used is $O(\log^2 n)$, since $S$ is a set of $O(\log n)$ strings, each of length $O(\log n)$.
  By \autoref{lem:small},
  \begin{equation*}
    \rank(G) \leq k \iff \bigwedge_{i = 1}^n g_i \in \cube_P(S),
  \end{equation*}
  so the reduction is a correct conjunctive truth-table reduction.

  The proof for groups is again similar.
  Instead of \autoref{lem:small}, we invoke \autoref{lem:log}, which states that any group of order $n$ has a generating set of size at most $\log n$.
  Also, we don't need to guess a parenthesization (although we still use $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits to guess the generating set).
  Therefore, the reduction will output $((G, g_1, S), \dotsc, (G, g_n, S))$, and the proof concludes with the fact that
  \begin{equation*}
    \rank(G) \leq k \iff \bigwedge_{i = 1}^n g_i \in \gen{S}.
    \qedhere
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:rank}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textsc{Magma Rank} is in $\NP$.
  \item \textsc{Semigroup Rank} is in $\NL$.
  \item \textsc{Quasigroup Rank} is in $\bFOLL$.
  \item \textsc{Group Rank} is in $\bFOLL \cap \bL$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Follows from \autoref{lem:ctt} and \autoref{lem:ranktomem}, along with
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \autoref{lem:submagmamem} for magmas,
  \item \autoref{lem:subsemigroupmem} for semigroups,
  \item \autoref{lem:cubemem} for quasigroups,
  \item \autoref{lem:subgroupmem} for groups.
  \end{enumerate}
  For groups the problem is also in $\bFOLL$ since a group is a quasigroup.
\end{proof}

A slight generalization of \autocite[Theorem~7]{py96} already proves that \textsc{Magma Rank} is in (and complete for) the class of problems decidable by a polynomial time Turing machine with $O(n \log n)$ nondeterministic bits.
We have nevertheless included the fact that \textsc{Magma Rank} is in $\NP$ to highlight the general strategy for proving these upper bounds for each class of algebraic structure.

We can almost show a reduction in the opposite direction of \autoref{lem:ranktomem}.
The \textsc{Submagma Rank} problem (a search problem) is defined as follows.
Given the Cayley table of a magma and a set of magma elements $S$, output the rank of $\gen{S}$.
(The \textsc{Submagma Rank} problem is more general than the \textsc{Magma Rank} problem: the latter reduces to the former by choosing $S = G$.)

\begin{proposition}
  \textsc{Submagma Membership} reduces to the \textsc{Submagma Rank} function by a nonadaptive $\AC_0$ Turing reduction making exactly two queries.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We know that for any magma $G$, any magma element $h$, and any subset of magma elements $S$,
  \begin{equation*}
    h \in \gen{S} \iff \rank(\gen{S}) = \rank(\gen{S \cup \{h\}}).
  \end{equation*}
  (This is analogous to the corresponding situation in linear algebra: a vector $h$ is in the span of a set of vectors $S$ exactly when the rank of $S$ does not increase when $h$ is added to $S$.)
  Thus the generator of the reduction is the function $(G, h, S) \mapsto ((G, S), (G, S \cup \{h\}))$ and the evaluator of the reduction compares $\rank({S})$ to $\rank(\gen{S \cup \{h\}})$ for equality.
\end{proof}

However, this reduction is not satisfying, because the \textsc{Submagma Rank} is essentially the \textsc{Magma Rank} problem when the input is provided as a set of generators instead of as a Cayley table.
As stated in the reduction, this representation may be exponentially smaller than the Cayley table representation.

Finally, although the precise relationship between $\FOLL$ and $\L$ is unknown, $\FOLL$ does not contain any class containing the \textsc{Parity} problem.
Since \textsc{Parity} is in $\L$, we know $\FOLL$ does not contain $\L$.
Stated in a slightly more general way, $\FOLL$ cannot be hard under $\AC^0$ many-one reductions for any complexity class that contains \textsc{Parity} \cite[Proposition~2.1]{bklm01}.
This is true even when the circuit is augmented with a polylogarithmic number of nondeterministic bits \cite[Section~4]{ctw13}.
This gives an immediate improvement to the upper bound of the \textsc{Quasigroup Rank} problem.

\begin{theorem}
  \textsc{Quasigroup Rank} is not hard under $\AC^0$ many-one reductions for any complexity class containing \textsc{Parity}.
\end{theorem}

Specifically, \textsc{Quasigroup Rank} is not hard for any of the classes in the inclusion chain
\begin{equation*}
  \ACC^0 \subseteq \TC^0 \subseteq \NC^1 \subseteq \L \subseteq \NL \subseteq (\LOGCFL \cup \DET).
