\section{Generalizations of rank}

\todo{Complexity of computing minimum covering set; see ``A covering problem over finite rings'' by Nakaoka and dos Santos, then ``The covering problem for finite rings with respect to the RT-metric'' by Yildiz, Siap, Bilgin, and Yesilot.
These also seem similar to minimizing rank while maximizing cardinalty of a set of elements, a specific case of the problem of minimizing a submodular function subject to a cardinality lower bound constraint, which is approximable but $\NP$-complete to solve exactly.}
